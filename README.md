# Perceptual Piercing: Human Visual Cue-Based Object Detection in Low Visibility Conditions
![Perceptual Piercing](/perceptual_piercing.png)

A novel machine-learning framework, inspired by the atmospheric scattering model and human visual cortex mechanisms, to enhance object detection under poor visibility scenarios such as fog, smoke, and haze. Implemented a multi-tiered strategy based on human-like visual cues that integrates an initial quick detection, followed by target-specific dehazing, and concludes with an in-depth detection phase.

## Installation

To set up the repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/perceptual-piercing.git
cd perceptual-piercing
```
2. Create a Virtual Environment
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install Required Libraries
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Download pre-trained models: Download the YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 pre-trained models and place them in the `models/` directory:

## AOD-NetX

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Prepare datasets using the corresponding `dataloader.py` script in the `AOD-NetX/` directory.
2. **Generate Bounding Box Annotations**: Use `yolov5_annotations.py` and `yolov8_annotations.py` scripts to create bounding box annotations from the dataset directory.
3. **Model Training**: Run `train.py` in the `AOD-NetX/` directory with clean images, foggy images, and the generated bounding box directory.
4. **Model Testing**: Execute `test.py` in the `AOD-NetX/` directory to assess the dehazing performance of the model.

## Full Pipeline Evaluation

To perform a complete evaluation of the pipeline, follow these steps:

- Quick Object Detection with Lightweight YOLO Models:
  - Use the `yolovx_annotations.py` script to perform initial object detection on the input images.
  - This step generates preliminary bounding boxes using a lightweight YOLO model (YOLOv5n or YOLOv8n).

- Dehazing the Detected Regions:
  - Use the bounding boxes from Step 1 to focus dehazing on specific regions of the images.
  - Run `test_FC.py` if evaluating on the Foggy Cityscapes dataset, or `test_RESIDE.py` for the OTS and RTTS subsets of the RESIDE dataset.

- Final Object Detection with High-Precision YOLO Models:
  - After dehazing, perform a final object detection using high-precision YOLO models (YOLOv5x or YOLOv8x) by re-running `yolovx_annotations.py` on the dehazed outputs.

- Performance Evaluation:
  - Run `metrics.py` to evaluate the detection performance using standard metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP).
  - This script compares the detection results on dehazed images with ground truth annotations.


## Evaluation Scripts
1. **General Dehazing Evaluation**: Run `dehazing_evaluation.py` in the `evaluation/` directory to evaluate the performance of any general dehazing method.
2. **Foggy Cityscapes Evaluation**: Use `test_FC.py` in the `evaluation/` directory to measure dehazing performance on the Foggy Cityscapes dataset.
3. **RESIDE Dataset Evaluation**: Use `test_RESIDE.py` in the `evaluation/` directory to evaluate dehazing performance on the OTS and RTTS subsets of the RESIDE dataset.
4. **Object Detection Performance**: Execute `metrics.py` in the `evaluation/` directory to assess object detection performance using the dehazed outputs.
