# Perceptual Piercing: Human Visual Cue-Based Object Detection in Low Visibility Conditions
A novel machine-learning framework, inspired by the atmospheric scattering model and human visual cortex mechanisms, to enhance object detection under poor visibility scenarios such as fog, smoke, and haze. Implemented a multi-tiered strategy based on human-like visual cues that integrates an initial quick detection, followed by target-specific dehazing, and concludes with an in-depth detection phase.
